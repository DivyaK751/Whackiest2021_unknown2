problem statement- Achieving social-distancing in public transport such as buses post lockdown.

Implementation-
We have a survey form which collects user inputs, stores them in a database and displays statistics.

Advantages-
The site can be used to display the peak hours of travel and most frequently used routes.
Number of buses alloted to each route can also be monitored.
Departure timings of each bus can be monitored.
Once the transportation system gets properly organised, many people will start opting for buses. This will reduce pollution, reduce traffic and will have low accident rates.
